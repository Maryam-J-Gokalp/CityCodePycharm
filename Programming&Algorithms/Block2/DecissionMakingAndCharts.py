# flow Chart components I, Start/end indicates the start or the end of a program
#flow arrow indicates the order of the execution in a program
from tkinter.font import names

# flow chart 2 is triangle and long, input/output indicates and input or output of the data in a program
# process indicates a state change via a statement an expression or calculation


#Flow Chart Components III
#Triangle and oval, tringle indicates a decission point in the flow of a peogram with yes/no branches
#ovall connector pairs of labelled connectors help avoid confussion with long or crossing flow arrows in the chart

# flow Chart I ---> Start, Multi[ply km by factor, print m
km = 5
factor = 1000
m = km * factor
print(m)

# flow chart example II---> start, read x, double x and print
x = int(input())
x = x * 2
print(x)

# flow chart examples III --> start, read n, read m, sum = n+m and print
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
print(sum)

# Draw a flow charts for the following code examples
# start, times by x plus 5,
x = 7    # start begin the process and utilize
x = x + 5   # Multiply value x = x (x + 5)
x = x -3  # subtract 3 from x: Set x = x -3
print(x)

# Flow chart, start ask for begin of input
name = input()   # ask for user's name
print(name)   #

# Flowchart,
y = int(input())    # input y, ask user to typy number
y **= 2              # Multiplies the number by itself
print(y)             # print the number and show the output
