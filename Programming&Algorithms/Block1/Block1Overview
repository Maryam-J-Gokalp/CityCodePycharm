Block 1: Overview
Introduction

Welcome to Block 1!

In this block we will begin by introducing you to the module and the programming language we will be using, which is Python. We donâ€™t expect you to have any prior knowledge of Python for this module. The first block in the module includes instructions on how to install Python so that you can learn to use it as we progress through the module. We also do not expect you to have any previous knowledge of programming and algorithms and so this week we will cover basic types of data before we introduce computer programs.

Please download this activity checklist  Download this activity checklistto help you track your progress through the block.
