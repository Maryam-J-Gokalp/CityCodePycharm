y = 3
y = 2 ** y
print(y)

#1. y = 2 --> y hold 3 and we assign variable 3 to the variable y
# y = 2 ** y --> If I have 2 and muiltiply it by itself 3 times
#  First: Multiplying (like 2 * 3) means you add 2 three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
# Raising to a power (2 ** 3) means you multiply 2 by itself three times:
# First: 2 * 2 = 4
# Second: 4 * 2 = 8
