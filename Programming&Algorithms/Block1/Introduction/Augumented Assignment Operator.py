x = 1
x += 1
print(x)

#Python to take the current value of x (which is 1), add 1 to it, and then store that new value back in x.
#After this line, x now holds the value 2 because 1 + 1 = 2.
#print(x):

#This command tells the computer to display the current value of x.
#Since x now holds the value 2 after the addition, it prints 2.

y = 5
y -=7
print(y)

# Assign the value 5 into current value y, which is 5
#y -= 7:
#The -= operator is a shorthand way of saying "subtract from the current value of y
#urrent value of y (which is 5) and subtract 7 from it.
#Now, y becomes 5 - 7, which equals -2. So, y now holds the value -2.

z = 4
z *= 3
print(z)

#The = sign here doesn’t mean "equal" like it does in math. In programming, = means assign. So, this line means we are giving or assigning the value 4 to a box called z.
#Imagine you have a box labeled z, and you put the number 4 inside the box.
#Example to Make it Easier:
#Imagine you have 4 apples (z = 4), and someone says, "Now triple the apples." You would now have 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 apples. That’s what this code does!

#Full Walkthrough:
#You start with z = 4 (putting the number 4 into the box called z).
#The z *= 3 tells the computer to multiply the value in z by 3. Multiplying is like repeating the number multiple times, so 4 becomes 12.
#print(z) shows the number 12, because that's the new value inside the box z.

w = 27
w/= 10
print("W")
# assigns the value 27 to the variable w
#augmented assignment operator, specifically for division. ake the value inside w (which is 27), divide it by 10, and store the result back in w
#So, dividing 27 by 10 gives you 2.7. Now, w contains 2.7


# below statement combining augmented assignment numeric operator

m = 1.0
m += 3 - 2
print("m")
#  assigns the value 1.0 to the variable m.
#First, the expression 3 - 2 is calculated. When you subtract 2 from 3, the result is 1.
#So, the line becomes m = m + 1.
#Since m started with the value 1.0, you now add 1 to it, which makes the new value of m equal to 2.0
#The value of m was originally 1.0. After the operation m += 3 - 2, the value of m becomes 2.0.
#However, the output will only show the letter "m", not the value. So, the final output of this code will be:


n = 5#
n += 2 * 2
print("n")
#variable n holding the data type 5, is assigned the value 5 to variable and n became 5
#The value of n was originally 5. After the operation n += 2 * 2, the value of n becomes 9.
# output will only show the letter "n", not the value. So, the final output of this code will be:

u = 3
u *=2 + 2
print(u)
# assign variable 3 to  variable n, so n become 3
#u *=2 + 2 this is like a math problem. First, we look at the part 2 + 2.
#What’s 2 plus 2? It’s 4!
# Now, we have u *= 4. This is just a shortcut for saying: 3 multiplied by 4? It’s 12!
#u is 12 --->print(u), it tells the computer, "Show me what’s inside the box u."
#And the computer shows the number 12


v = 27
v/= 5 + 5
