j = 10
j = j / 4
print(j)

# j = 10: You assign the value 10 to the variable j.
# j = j / 4: You divide the current value of j (which is 10) by 4. So, j becomes 10 / 4 = 2.5. This result is a floating-point number (decimal), not an integer.
# print(j): This prints the updated value of j, which is 2.5.
# result float coz 2 number divide / using / operator
