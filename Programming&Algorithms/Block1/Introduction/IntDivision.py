m = 5
m = m // 2
print(m)

# m = 5: This assigns the value 5 to the variable m. So, m is holding the number 5.
# m = m // 2: This line uses the // operator, which means floor division. This divides m by 2 and rounds down the result to the nearest whole number.
# When we divide 5 by 2, the result is 2.5.
# But since // is floor division, we drop the decimal part (the .5), leaving us with just 2.
# print(m): This prints the current value of m, which is now 2


y = 3
y = 2 ** y
print(y)

#1. y = 2 --> y hold 3 and we assign variable 3 to the variable y
# y = 2 ** y --> If I have 2 and muiltiply it by itself 3 times
#  First: Multiplying (like 2 * 3) means you add 2 three times: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
# Raising to a power (2 ** 3) means you multiply 2 by itself three times:
# First: 2 * 2 = 4
# Second: 4 * 2 = 8

n = 5.5
n = n // 2
print(n)
